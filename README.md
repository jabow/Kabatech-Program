# Kabatech-Program
The C16/Kabatech machines use a MS-DOS based file (.clc) that must be recreated by this software to work on the machine itself.  This is handled by being able to import and export the .clc files into and out of the excel spreadsheet.

The .clc File
It is important that the layout, structure and text within the .clc are perfect for the program to function correctly on the c16 machines.  If there are errors in this file then it is unlikely that the MS-DOS system will accept the program as what it is.  The .clc files can be opened using Microsoft Notepad.  The following diagram shows some important characteristics of the .clc file.
